## Voulez-vous du fromage?

To get started with Fromage in your Pytorch code, copy the file `fromage.py` into your project directory, then write:
```
from fromage import Fromage
optimizer = Fromage(net.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```
We found an initial learning rate of 0.01 worked well in all experiments except model fine-tuning, where we used 0.001. You may want to experiment with learning rate decay schedules.

## About this repository

We've written an academic paper that proposes an optimisation algorithm based on a new geometric characterisation of deep neural networks. The paper is called:

> [On the distance between two neural networks and the stability of learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03432).

We're putting this code here so that you can test out our optimisation algorithm in your own applications, and also so that you can attempt to reproduce the experiments in our paper.

If something isn't clear or isn't working, let us know in the *Issues section* or contact [bernstein@caltech.edu](mailto:bernstein@caltech.edu).
