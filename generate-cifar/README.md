Fromage ðŸ§€ optimiser
</h1>

## CIFAR-10 class conditional GAN

The following Python packages are required: numpy, torch, torchvision, tqdm.

An example job is
```
python main.py --optim fromage --lrG 0.01 --lrD 0.01 --epochs 121 --seed 0
```
See inside `main.py` for additional command line arguments.

## Results

Runnning `sh batch.sh`, we obtain the following results:

|         | train FID  | test FID   |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Fromage | 16.4 Â± 0.5 | 16.3 Â± 0.8 |
| Adam    | 19.1 Â± 0.9 | 19.4 Â± 1.1 |
| SGD     | 36.4 Â± 2.5 | 36.7 Â± 2.7 |
